## Things to notice
env files are usually not deployed on git, but for testing purpose and making it easy I'll deploy it here.

## features missing
- Data sources are all different, filters could not be the same for the 3 of them, some of them has all, some don't.
- Lack of design left it open for improvisation and guessing.
